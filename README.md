## Installation

To run these animations locally, you need to have Python and Manim installed on your system. Follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Manim Library (Community Edition)

### Steps to Install

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Manim**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   pip install manim
   ```

3. **Clone this Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Mathematics-Animations.git
   cd Mathematics-Animations
   ```

4. **Run an Animation**:
   Use the following command to render an animation:
   ```bash
   manim -pqh <filename>.py <SceneName> -r 1080,1920
   ```
   Replace `<filename>` with the name of the Python file and `<SceneName>` with the specific scene you want to render in 16:9 (portrait).
